# Rental Heaven

A web application about renting cars that I developed while getting
used to React JS and Firebase. It has CRUD functionality, authentication, conditional
rendering based on the user's level of access and is completely
responsive. Pagination, search and filter options are implemented
alongside session storage, providing better user experience.

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, React JS, Firebase

## Demo
